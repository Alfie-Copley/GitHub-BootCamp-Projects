# Cloud Computing Workbook Summary

## Day 1: Task 1 – Introduction to Cloud Computing
Researched fundamental cloud computing concepts and business benefits.

### What Cloud Computing Does
- Provides on-demand access to computing resources (storage, databases, software, servers) via the internet.
- **Real-world uses:** data storage, collaboration tools, backup/recovery, scalable apps, remote work enablement.

### Business Benefits
- **Cost-effective:** Pay-as-you-go model removes need for hardware investment.  
- **Scalable:** Instantly adjust resources based on demand.  
- **Secure and reliable:** High-level security, data recovery, and global access.  
- **Innovative:** Rapid deployment of apps/services.  
- **Remote access:** Enables flexible, distributed teams.

### Alternatives to Cloud
- **On-premises infrastructure:** Full control but high cost, limited scalability, requires maintenance and IT teams.

### Major Cloud Providers and Key Features
| Provider | Features | Common Uses |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **AWS** | Broad services, global data centres, scalability | Hosting, analytics, disaster recovery |
| **Microsoft Azure** | Integrates with Microsoft 365, hybrid solutions | Business analytics, app hosting |
| **Google Cloud** | AI/ML tools, cost efficiency | Data processing, app development |
| **IBM Cloud** | Strong hybrid/AI focus | Enterprise and security-heavy workloads |

## Day 1: Task 2 – Cloud Service Models

### IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service
- Virtualised computing resources (servers, networks, storage).  
- **Use cases:** hosting websites, scaling workloads, disaster recovery.  
- **Examples:** AWS EC2, Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine.

### PaaS – Platform as a Service
- Provides ready-made environments for developers to build and deploy apps.  
- **Use cases:** app development, prototyping, scaling apps.  
- **Examples:** GCP App Engine, Azure App Service, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku.

### SaaS – Software as a Service
- Fully functional apps delivered via internet browser or app.  
- **Use cases:** collaboration, file storage, CRM, project management.  
- **Examples:** Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Salesforce, Slack, Dropbox.

## Day 1: Task 3 – Cloud Deployment Models

| Cloud Model | Description | Example Use Case |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Public Cloud** | Shared resources provided by third-party vendors. | Small e-commerce site hosting via AWS. |
| **Private Cloud** | Dedicated environment for one organisation; higher control/security. | Bank protecting sensitive financial data. |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | Combines public and private clouds for flexibility. | Hospital storing records privately but using Azure for analytics. |
| **Community Cloud** | Shared between organisations with common goals or compliance needs. | Universities sharing research data. |

## Day 2: Task 1 – Computer Misuse Act and Data Protection

### Computer Misuse Act (1990)
Addresses unauthorised computer activity:
1. **Unauthorised Access** – Accessing data/systems without permission (e.g., student viewing confidential files).  
2. **Access with Intent to Commit Offences** – Hacking to commit fraud or theft (e.g., stealing banking info).  
3. **Unauthorised Acts to Impair Operation** – Disrupting systems or spreading malware (e.g., DoS attacks).

### Police and Justice Act (2006) Updates
- **Harsher penalties** – Up to 10 years imprisonment.  
- **New offence** – Intentional impairment of computer operations.  
- **Hacking tool offence** – Illegal to create, share, or use hacking software.

### Data Employers Can Store
- **Without permission:** Contact info, employment details, attendance/performance.  
- **With permission:** Health/medical data, biometric data, personal beliefs.

### Copyright and Software Piracy
- **Copyright infringement:** Sharing music or files without permission.  
- **Plagiarism:** Copying and submitting someone’s work without credit.  
- **Consequences:** Legal prosecution, financial loss, malware risk, lack of support, fines.

### Related Acts and Clauses
Covers legislation such as:
- **Computer Misuse Act 1990**
- **Police and Justice Act 2006**
- **Copyright Acts 1988 & 1992**
- **Data Protection Act 2018**
- **Health & Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations 1992**
- **Consumer Rights Act 2015**

## Day 3: Task 1 – Explore Relational Data in Azure
Completed Lab 3: Investigated relational data within Azure environments using SQL-based queries, examining data structure, table relationships, and storage principles.

## Day 3: Task 2 – Explore Non-Relational Data in Azure
Completed Lab 4: Explored non-relational (NoSQL) data models in Azure, focusing on flexible data formats, scalability, and real-world cloud-based data handling.

---

**Overall Focus:**  
Developed foundational cloud computing knowledge — from service models and deployment types to cybersecurity and data protection laws — with practical cloud labs in Microsoft Azure.
